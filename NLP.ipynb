    "# Why is it difficult to work with text?\n",
    "Comprehending Language is hard for computers. Some of the unique challenges of working with text are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Synonymy - This corresponds to different words having the same meaning. A similar intent can be conveyed in various ways and this is one of the prime reasons, why computers have a hard time deciphering the meaning or intent of those statements. \"The President of United States has signed a new decree\" and \"POTUS has inked in a new law\" are basically advocating the same sentiment. However as they are completely different sentences syntactically, computers have a hard time figuring out the user intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity - \"The bank deposit rate is quite high\" and \"He stood near the bank admiring the river\". In these statements, the word bank has completely different meanings. In the first case it represents a financial institution, and in the second case it refers to land near the river. Disambiguating the meaning in sentences is quite challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaphora Resolution - \"George is my friend. He likes football\". In the second statement he refers to George. It is difficult for the computers to discern what person/entity the pronoun he is referring to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language related issues - Every language has its own uniqueness. For English we have words, sentences, paragraphs and so on. But in Thai, there is no concept of sentences at all! The grammar and morphology of languages is so different. This is why we observe that Google Translator or any other translator service struggles to perfectly convert a piece of text from one language to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of Vocabulary problem - Machines have a hard time adapting to any new constructs that humans come up with. As humans when we come across a word we haven't seen earlier, we might not understand its meaning instantly. But this does not mean we cannot adapt. After looking at the word in several different sentences and understanding its usage, we understand the context and meaning of the new word. Machines can only handle data that they have seen before. It is unable to adapt well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language generation - While language understanding is hard, language generation too has its own set of challenges. For chatbots to work effectively, they need to communication properly constructed sentences which are grammatically correct. This is quite a hard problem and a challenge that needs to be overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know that working with text is hard. But there are also exciting applications and use cases involved with working on text. We will now take a look at some of the use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Usecases of NLP</h2>\n",
    "The usecases of NLP encompass almost anything you can do with Language in relation to a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Sentiment Analysis - Finding if the text is leaning towards a positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral is called Sentiment Analysis. The information present over the Internet is constantly growing resulting in a large number of texts expressing opinions in review sites, forums, blogs and different social media forums. Sentiment analysis is therefore a topic of great interest and development since it has many practical applications. It is immensely useful in figuring the overall sentiment of products (Amazon), movies (Netflix), food (Yelp),etc. Its applications include Market Research, Social Monitoring, Customer Support and Product Analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Text Classification - Categorizing text to various categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize almost any text data we have. For e.g. New articles can be organized by topics, chat conversations can be organized by language, support tickets can be organized by urgency etc. Other examples of text classification include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Directing customer queries to the right vertical\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection of spam and non-spam emails,\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto tagging of customer queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Document Summarization - Compressing a paragraph/document into few words or sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the method of compressing a text document, in order to create a summary of the major points of the document. The idea of summarization is to find a subset of data which contains the information of the entire set. It's applications include News summary(Inshorts app), Novel Summary, Book Summary (Blinkist) etc. With the overall attention span declining, the need to provide information in the shortest possible words has risen - and summarization helps solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Parts of Speech Tagging - Figuring out the various nouns, adverbs, verbs etc in the text\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying part of speech tags is much more complicated than it looks. This is because over time in the development of language, a single word can have different parts of speech tag in different sentences based on different contexts. This makes it impossible to have a generic mapping for POS tags. Few of its applications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text to speech conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Sense Disambiguation (Teach machine to know the difference of the meaning of word 'bears' in \"I saw a couple of bears\" and \"Hard work always bears fruit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Machine translation - Translate text from one language to another\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Translation is the task of automatically translating one natural language into another while retaining the meaning of the original text. Translation from one language to another is complex because some of the words in the original language could have multiple meanings and these words could have different forms in the output language. Its most popular application is Google Translate and it is employed in devices like Google Home as well. Machine translation allows business transactions between partners in different countries without the need of a human interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Named Entity Recognition - Identify the entities present in text\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition deals with named entity mentions in text and categorizes these entities into person, organization, datetime reference etc. This is used a lot in the field of bioinformatics, molecular biology and other medical NLP applications. It also plays an important role in the overall field of Information Extraction where we try to extract knowledge from unstructured text.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Conversational AI - Chat with a machine in natural language and get queries resolved\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational AI deals with creating an interface between machines and humans to converse in natural language. Such interfaces are known as chatbots. A user can interact in natural language with natural language, the same way he usually communicates with a human. For organizations to truly scale in terms of customer support, chatbots are increasingly adopted as the first point of contact for customer query resolution across all organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for enabling all the NLP usecases, the first challenge is to convert the text into a form that the machine can understand. For that, we need to arrive at a fundamental component of text known as tokens."

    "<h3> Motivation for tokenization</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that unlike all the machine learning datasets we have worked with previously, the data isn't boolean, numeric, categorical etc. Usually a text is composed of paragraphs, paragraphs are composed of sentences, and sentences are composed of words. You could also go deeper into letters, but the letters have no meaning. It's only when they are combined into words, that the text starts to make sense. Hence, it is better to work at the word level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into smaller parts called tokens. Tokens are the basic units of a particular dataset. The choice of tokens could be based on the application we are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Introduction to NLTK</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Tool Kit/NLTK is the standard library in python which specifically deals with text. All the text processing tasks could be easily done with this library. It is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It also provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, along with an active discussion forum. On top of it, it is completely free and open-source with a vibrant developer community supporting it. Let us now take the first step towards categorizing the consumer complaints by starting with tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Tokenizing with NLTK - The problem intuition</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first need to find a way to convert the text to numbers to get them to a form where you would be able to apply an algorithm to this. Think of this like sklearn, which require all non-numeric data to be encoded (label or one-hot) prior to the sklearn pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, it would make sense to divide each paragraph of text to its basic form (words) and then convert each of those words to numbers. We could assign a particular number to each word, in which case a sentence could look like a set of numbers to us, each number representing a particular word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to achieving that would be to break the text down to words. That's what tokenization aims to do. NLTK has a built in libraries for tokenization which we will use for our purpose."
